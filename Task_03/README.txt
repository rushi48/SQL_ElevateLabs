# SQL Developer Internship – Task 3

This repository contains SQL queries written as part of the SQL Developer Internship (Task 3).  
The objective is to practice basic `SELECT` queries and data retrieval techniques on the `world` database.

---

## 🧠 **Key Concepts Practiced**
- Selecting all columns (`SELECT *`)
- Selecting specific columns
- Filtering data using `WHERE`
- Range filtering with `BETWEEN`
- Sorting results using `ORDER BY`
- Limiting output with `LIMIT`
- Getting distinct values (`DISTINCT`)
- Analyzing data with criteria like `population`, `indepyear`, `Percentage`

---

## 🧑‍💻 **Files**
- **Task_03.sql** — The SQL file containing all queries.
- **README.md** — Documentation file describing the task.

## 📝 **Queries Overview**
Here’s a brief summary of the queries included in `Task_03.sql`:
1. Retrieve all columns from the `city` table.
2. Retrieve specific columns (`name`, `district`, `population`) from `city`.
3. Filter cities with population greater than 200,000.
4. Retrieve all columns from `countrylanguage`.
5. Filter languages with `Percentage` between 10 and 50.
6. Order most used languages by `Percentage` descending and limit to top 5.
7. Order countries by most populated and limit to top 10.
8. Fetch distinct country names with their independence years.
